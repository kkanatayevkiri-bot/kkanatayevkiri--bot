    <h1>What are PokeBalls?</h1>
    <p>Poké Balls are specialized, spherical devices in the Pokémon franchise used to catch, carry, and store Pokémon by converting them into energy.<br>
    They allow trainers to transport large creatures easily, with the devices functioning as both storage and a, often comfortable, habitat. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Key Aspects of Poké Balls:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Function:</b> Upon hitting a Pokémon, the ball opens and converts the creature into energy, storing it inside.<br>
            Captured Pokémon become loyal to the trainer, though they still possess free will.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Types:</b> There are 5 types of balls in Pokemon gen 1, such as the basic Poké Ball,<br>
            the stronger Great Ball and Ultra Ball,Master Ball (guaranteed catch) and Safari Ball Used exclusively in the Safari Zone, with a catch rate similar to an Ultra Ball.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While they generally work by shrinking Pokémon into a pocket-sized form,<br>
    the lore sometimes suggests they create a comfortable, specialized, or even, in some interpretations, a data-driven, virtual environment for the creature inside. </p>
